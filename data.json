        "I aided the effort to track the effect of COVID-19 on air traffic patterns in the United States. I constructed a data pipeline to consolidate and structure data from JHU, the Opensky Network, FAA, BTS, and NASA's Sherlock Data Warehouse. I also implemented random forest machine learning algorithms to model air traffic in the US and predict air traffic patterns in the future."

        "I led an effort to optimize a modular drone for any task. My team and I implemented the ranking function used to select drones best suited to specified tasks. I also developed a web app allowing users to specify drone missions/tasks and to receive building instructions for the optimal drone.",
        "As part of this internship, I co-wrote a technical conference paper for AIAA's 2020 Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Forum."
